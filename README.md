Advanced Promise Queue

Designed to configure and forget if needed and function the same as normal promises.

Example uses coming soon.

Events planned for the queue.

'empty' The queued tasks are done

'paused' Somewhere code has paused the queue

'resumed' queue.resume(); has been called when the queue was paused
